This directory contains Linux shell scripts that can be used to perform 
OAI harvests, schema validation and XSL transforms.

To install and use the scripts:

1. Copy the scripts to an appropriate location on your Linux or UNIX system, 
for example /usr/local/bin

2. Copy the required JAR library files to an approprate directory, 
for example /usr/local/bin/libs/ The required JAR files are described
in each script file. The JAR files can be obtained from the 
WEB-INF/lib/ directory of your jOAI installation.

3. Edit the script files as described in each to point to 
JAVA_HOME and the required library files

4. Make the scripts executable (e.g. run the command chmod 774)

5. Execute the script with no arguments to display usage information
